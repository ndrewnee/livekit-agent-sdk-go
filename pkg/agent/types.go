// Package agent provides a framework for building LiveKit agents that can process
// audio, video, and data streams in real-time. Agents are server-side applications
// that join LiveKit rooms as participants and can interact with other participants.
//
// The package supports different types of agents:
//   - Room agents: Join when a room is created
//   - Participant agents: Join when participants connect
//   - Publisher agents: Join when participants start publishing media
//
// Key features:
//   - Automatic job assignment and load balancing
//   - Graceful shutdown and job recovery
//   - Resource monitoring and limits
//   - Connection resilience with automatic reconnection
//   - Extensible plugin system for custom functionality

// JobHandler is the interface that agents must implement to handle jobs.
// A job represents a task assigned to an agent, typically involving joining
// a LiveKit room and performing some processing on the media streams or
// interacting with participants.
//
// Implementations should be thread-safe as methods may be called concurrently.
type JobHandler interface {
	// OnJobRequest is called when a job is offered to the agent.
	// The agent should inspect the job details and decide whether to accept it.
	// If accepted, the agent should return metadata specifying how it will join the room.
	//
	// This method should return quickly as the server waits for the response.
	// Heavy initialization should be deferred to OnJobAssigned.
	//
	// Parameters:
	//   - ctx: Context for the request, may have a deadline
	//   - job: The job being offered, contains room and participant information
	//
	// Returns:
	//   - accept: true to accept the job, false to decline
	//   - metadata: Agent participant metadata if accepting (can be nil)

	// This is where the main agent logic should be implemented.
	//
	// The method should block until the agent's work is complete or the context is cancelled.
	// Returning an error will mark the job as failed.
	//
	// Parameters:
	//   - ctx: Context for the job, cancelled when the job should terminate
	//   - job: The assigned job with full details
	//   - room: Connected room client for interacting with the room
	//
	// Returns:
